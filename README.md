This should work fine, sorry there is just one commit, but had some issues setting up Jest, so ended up running:
> npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app ðŸ¤¦

and copying the files:

### Requirements:
Every requirement should work as expected including the nice to have.

### Notes:
Forgot to add .nvm so use Node >= v18.17.0
I also did this in Ubuntu on my home PC so if you have any issues running the app (on mac?) let me know
Didn't focus too much on the UI but more in the functionality.
I'm not a NextJS expert so I'm sure I didn't use a lot of the functionality like serverProps etc,
Haven't used redux in like 5 years, so keep that in mind :)
If you have more request or questions, please let me know.

### Feedback about the test
There is no really a case for using redux or next JS here but I appreciate is the stack you use, it just feels a bit forced for someone applying for a Principal role.
There is also a lot of boilerplate with nextJs, and how it works with routing, server rendering, etc, so feels a bit too much for this use case.
That being said, I enjoyed it and learned a few things.

best, Tomas
